    <h3>La La Land</h4>
    <p>2016</p>

    Best soundtrack of all times. Unbelievable performance of Emma Stone.
    The plot is in my opinion not as important as the feeling the viewers
    are confronted with. It is a mix of life's drama and how the one true
    love is inwoven into that.
    On the one hand the broken existence of the Jazz pianist on the other
    the young woman who tries so hard to become a part of Hollywood as an actress.
    They share their love but cannot share one space.
    Both fighting for them slowly realizing, they're breaking apart.
    It makes the viewer realize the feeling of being close to someone is
    as fragile as love itself.
    The best moment is the time recap of how things should have been for
    a happy ending. It remains a bitter sweat sensation made out of
    broken love and fullfilled dreams and a kind of happiness that comes
    uncomfortable close to reality.
    It is not the perfect love story, but in my opinion the perfect imperfection.
    The super bad first scene of dancing people is excused by last 10 minutes
    blowing setting a complete new standard on cinematic acting.
    The fusion of musical like 50s and a modern picture worked perfectly.
